# MODELLING-OF-UNDERWATER-ROV
This project involves designing and analyzing an autonomous ROV for underwater inspection, developed in Fusion 360 and SolidWorks. Equipped with propulsion, sensors, and a communication module, it enables ocean floor navigation and monitoring.

##  Turtle-Inspired Mini Underwater ROV Design

This turtle-inspired ROV features a compact, closed-frame cylindrical body housing key electronics (batteries, microcontrollers, etc.), ideal for underwater movement. The frame is robust against impacts, with five thrusters configured for precise maneuvering: two vertical thrusters for up/down movement and two horizontal, adjustable thrusters for forward, backward, lateral, and rotational motion. Analysis of the frame was conducted using Acrylic and Polycarbonate materials to ensure durability and efficiency in underwater conditions.

The ROV is designed to withstand up to 10 bar of pressure, providing a safety factor of 8 at 100 meters depth. Collision tests indicate high durability at the edges, though minor denting may occur near thruster connections at maximum depth, risking leakage. The model's buoyancy supports a load capacity of 20 kg, with each thruster capable of handling 5 kg, ensuring maneuverability in compact spaces. For neutral buoyancy, flotation materials like rigid Polyurethane foam balance the heavier components.

The frame, essential for stability and strength, is designed from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) due to its corrosion resistance, lightweight properties, and ease of machining. Stainless Steel and Aluminum offer strength but are prone to corrosion; Polypropylene and HDPE provide corrosion resistance, with HDPE selected as the optimal material for the frame.
